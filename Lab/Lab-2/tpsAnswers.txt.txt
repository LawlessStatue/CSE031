TPS 2:

	1. 'gcc -g punishment.c -o punish'
	2. 'gdb punish'
	3. 'run'
	4. Breakpoints causes the debugger to puase the execution at a specific line. to run it use command 'break [line number]'.
	5. To run the program line by line we have to use the 'next' command.
	6. We have to use 'print [variable]' to see the value of the variable while debugging.
	7. 'continue' cmd let's you finish the program's run.
	8. to exit we use 'quit'

TPS 3:

	1. Five variables are declared: x, y, px, py, and arr. px and py are int pointers.
	2. The values of x, y, and arr[0] are undefined if you run the program without initializing these variables. 
	   They could be any value that was previously stored at those memory locations. You can insert printf statements to display their values like so:
	   'printf("x: %d, y: %d, arr[0]: %d\n", x, y, arr[0]);'
	3. int x = 0;
	   int y = 0;
	   int arr[10] = {0};
	4. printf("Address of x: %p\n", (void *)&x);
	   printf("Address of y: %p\n", (void *)&y);
	5. px = &x;
	   py = &y;

	   printf("Value of px: %p, Address of px: %p\n", (void *)px, (void *)&px);
	   printf("Value of py: %p, Address of py: %p\n", (void *)py, (void *)&py);

	6. for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    		printf("%d ", *(arr + i));
	   }
	   printf("\n");
  	7. printf("%p == %p\n", (void *)arr, (void *)&arr[0]);
	8. printf("Address of arr: %p\n", (void *)arr);
